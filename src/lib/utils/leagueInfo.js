  <p>Welcome to THE Dynasty League, Where You’re All Pretending to Be GMs, But Let’s Be Real—Most of You Are Just Here to Lose Money and Dignity.</p>
  <p>This league was born from a bunch of college buddies who thought they knew football because they watched SportsCenter in between classes (or skipped classes for it), and a group of work friends who clearly have way too much time on their hands during office hours. Now, we've merged into one, highly dysfunctional dynasty league where poor decisions are immortalized, bad trades are forever, and your mistakes will haunt you longer than your student loans.</p>
  <p>And speaking of dynasty... this isn't your one-and-done fantasy league. Oh no. You're stuck with the terrible roster choices you make forever. You draft a bust? Congratulations, that’s your problem for the next 5 years. Trade away your future for one good season? We’ll make sure to remind you every time that rookie you gave up becomes an all-star while your star player “rests” on IR.</p>
  <p>Now, a word of advice: half of you are going to treat the draft like it's the NFL Combine, as if we haven't all watched you take kickers in the 9th round in previous leagues. The other half will "forget" to set their lineups by Week 3, then blame it on "work" (as if any of us are busy on Sundays).</p>
  <p>But here's the real truth: most of you will spend more time crafting clever trash talk than setting a winning lineup. And you know what? That’s fine. Because let’s face it—only one of us is leaving with the title, and the rest of you are just here to provide free wins and bad decisions we’ll roast you for all season long.</p>
  <p>So strap in, because this league isn't just about fantasy football—it's about who can screw up the least and still somehow think they have a shot at a championship.</p>
  <p>Welcome to your yearly dose of humiliation.</p>
